                                    The Star Wars Battlefront II beta will begin on October 4th for players who pre-ordered the game and will open to everyone on October 6th. The beta will conclude on October 9th, giving players several days to explore the game's new features and content.
                                </p>

                                    The beta will feature the Galactic Assault mode on Naboo's Theed city, where players can participate in 40-player battles as either the Separatist droid army or the Republic clone troopers. This is the same epic battle that was showcased at E3 2017.
                                </p>
