                                    CD Projekt Red has announced that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has received a new update that brings 4K resolution support to PlayStation 4 Pro owners. Additionally, the developer confirmed that Xbox One X support is on the way.
                                </p>

                                <h2>PS4 Pro Update Details</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The PS4 Pro update, which is available now, offers enhanced performance for Sony's more powerful console. The update brings the following improvements:
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>4K resolution support</li>
                                    <li>Enhanced performance for base PS4</li>
                                    <li>Stability improvements</li>
                                    <li>Minor visual improvements</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>
                                    The update makes the already gorgeous game look even better, with increased detail in character models, environments, and lighting effects. Players with 4K televisions will notice the most dramatic improvements, but even those with standard HD displays should see some visual enhancements.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Xbox One X Support Coming</h2>

While no specific release date was given, the developer stated that it would be available "soon" and promised that it would take full advantage of the console's powerful hardware.
                                </p>

                                <ul>
