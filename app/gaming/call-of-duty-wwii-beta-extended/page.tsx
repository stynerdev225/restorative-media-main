                                    Sledgehammer Games has announced a two-day extension to the Call of Duty: WWII multiplayer beta, giving players additional time to experience the franchise's return to its World War II roots. Originally scheduled to end today, the beta will now continue until Tuesday, September 5, at 10 AM PT, with several new features being added for the extended period.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The extension comes in response to enthusiastic player engagement throughout the beta's first weekend. Activision reports that millions of players have participated in the test, providing valuable feedback that will help refine the game before its full release in November. Along with the extended playtime, Sledgehammer is introducing new content to give players a more comprehensive look at what the final game will offer.

                                    The most significant addition to the extended beta is the new map, Aachen. Based on the German city that saw intense fighting during the Battle of Aachen in 1944, the map features a mix of close-quarters street combat and longer sightlines through bombed-out buildings. Players must navigate through partially collapsed structures, debris-filled streets, and underground passages as they engage in firefights across this war-torn urban landscape.
                                </p>

                                    "Aachen demonstrates our commitment to authentic World War II environments," explained Michael Condrey, co-founder of Sledgehammer Games. "We've recreated the devastation of urban warfare while maintaining a map design that offers diverse combat opportunities for different playstyles. It's a good example of how we're balancing historical accuracy with engaging gameplay."

                                    The addition of Kill Confirmed adds another classic Call of Duty game mode to the beta. In this team-based mode, players must collect dog tags dropped by defeated enemies to score points. Simply eliminating opponents isn't enough‚Äîsecuring the dog tag confirms the kill and earns points for your team. Players can also deny enemy points by collecting their teammates' dog tags before opponents can reach them.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Kill Confirmed joins Team Deathmatch, Domination, Hardpoint, and War as the available modes in the beta. War mode, a new narrative-driven multiplayer experience unique to Call of Duty: WWII, has been particularly well-received by players during the beta's first weekend.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Level Cap Increase</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Raising the level cap from 25 to 30 gives players access to new weapons, equipment, and scorestreaks. Notable additions include the M1A1 Carbine for the Infantry Division, new Basic Training skills, and the Flamethrower scorestreak. The Flamethrower allows players to unleash streams of fire on enemies, creating both direct damage and area denial capabilities.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The level cap increase also unlocks additional weapon attachments and division skills, giving players more opportunities to customize their loadouts and experiment with different combat strategies. These new progression rewards provide a glimpse into the deeper customization options that will be available in the full game.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Technical Improvements</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The extended beta also incorporates several technical improvements based on player feedback from the first weekend. These include adjustments to spawn points, weapon balancing tweaks, and fixes for various bugs identified by the community. Sledgehammer has particularly focused on server stability and matchmaking improvements to ensure smoother online play.

                                    "We've already implemented numerous changes based on the data and feedback from the first weekend," explained Glen Schofield, co-founder of Sledgehammer Games. "The extension gives us an opportunity to test these refinements with a large player base and make further adjustments before launch. We're committed to delivering the best possible experience when the game releases in November."

                                <h2>Positive Reception</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The beta has been generally well-received by players and critics alike, with particular praise directed at the game's return to a boots-on-the-ground approach after several years of futuristic Call of Duty titles featuring advanced movement mechanics. The World War II setting has also drawn positive comments, with many appreciating the authentic weapons, environments, and overall atmosphere.

                                    The new Divisions system, which replaces the traditional Create-a-Class feature, has generated mixed feedback. Some players appreciate the streamlined approach and the distinct playstyles offered by each Division, while others miss the more flexible customization of previous games. Sledgehammer has indicated they're carefully evaluating feedback regarding this new system.
                                </p>

                                    Call of Duty: WWII is scheduled for release on November 3, 2017, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. A second beta period is expected to take place before launch, likely including PC players who have not yet had the opportunity to test the game.
